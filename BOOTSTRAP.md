# BOOTSTRAP — fresh product from this baseline, in phases

How to go from **nothing** to a **fully deployed, documented baseline**
(all terraform infra, the 12-worker fleet, api-edge, the console — live on
stage+prod) with ONE provider consent.

There is one artifact: **`repo-blueprint.yaml`**. It declares what to place,
in what order, what each phase needs first, and what to say while it runs.
`orun new` is the whole runtime — the phases below are its `--phase` names,
not separate workflows. Everything that used to live in a `flows/` shell
layer is now a typed action inside the binary, which is why the version floor
matters and why a phase can be run alone, months later, from a fresh
container.

Target wall-clock: **under an hour**. The long pole is the worker fleet's
two landings — the Cloudflare-only data plane creates in seconds, which is
where this baseline is cheaper than a Postgres-backed one.

## 0. What you need

- GitHub org access (repo creation) and a machine with `git`, `gh`, `node`
  (≥20), `pnpm`, `python3`, and the `orun` CLI **≥ v2.56.2** (same floor as
  the product lane pin). v2.56.0 is the first release carrying the phase
  overlay this blueprint uses — before it there is no `--phase` flag and
  `hooks.{pre,post,await}` does not parse. v2.56.2 is the first that can run
  it **past phase 01**: a phase that brands what it places derives as
  `drifted` from then on, and the requirement gate used to refuse that.
- A Cloudflare account (Workers paid plan for the fleet) and its **Account
  API token** (the console's Connect recipe lists the exact permission
  groups). It is the ONLY provider credential this baseline needs — and it
  must be able to mint both the `workers-deploy` and `d1-edit` scopes, i.e.
  its permission groups include D1 Write.
- An Orun Cloud workspace for the product, passed as `orunWorkspace`, with an
  **admin-role API key** for headless runs (builder/viewer keys can read but
  their secret writes are denied — masked as `not_found`).
- **The repo allow-listed in the workspace** (console → Settings → Git
  repos). This is the ONE console action a workspace-scoped token cannot
  self-heal (`cloud link` is refused for them) — do it up front or
  `03-infrastructure`'s provider check will stop and ask for it. Everything
  else is headless.

## 1. One command: `--resume`

The whole bootstrap, unattended. `--resume` places every phase not already
derived as done, in dependency order, honouring each phase's barrier:

```bash
git clone --depth 1 --branch <baseline-tag> https://github.com/sourceplane/cirrus
cd cirrus

orun new --blueprint repo-blueprint.yaml \
  --out ~/sourceplane/acme --run-hooks --resume \
  --set reponame=acme --set productname="Acme Cloud" \
  --set productdomain=acme.dev --set githubOrg=sourceplane \
  --set orunWorkspace=ws_XXXXXXXX \
  --set subdomain=<workers-dev-subdomain>
```

**`--run-hooks` is the difference between placing files and bootstrapping a
product.** Without it `orun new` writes the tree and stops: no repo is
created, nothing is landed, no convergence is watched, and no phase probes
its preconditions. That is deliberate — it is what makes a dry instantiation
of this baseline possible in CI with no workspace and no provider.

`--resume` is safe to re-run from anywhere, including a fresh container with
a fresh `--out`: **phase state is derived from the tree, never stored.** A
phase whose files are all present but differ from the blueprint — which is
every phase after `01-scaffold` brands the tree — derives as `drifted`, and
`--resume` leaves it placed rather than reverting your product's identity to
`cirrus`.

## 1b. Or phase by phase — the same document, at your pace

The phases are `01-scaffold`, `02-foundation`, `03-infrastructure`,
`04-workers`, `04-workers-restore`, `05-edge`, `06-console`, `07-domain`
(only when `--set domain=true`), `08-docs`. Each is idempotent, each follows
one contract — **place its modules → land them → watch the convergence →
verify the outcome** — and each carries its own narration. Full guide:
[docs/phases/README.md](docs/phases/README.md), with a detailed page per
phase in that folder.

```bash
# phase 01 takes the identity once:
orun new --blueprint repo-blueprint.yaml --out ~/sourceplane/acme --run-hooks \
  --phase 01-scaffold \
  --set reponame=acme --set productname="Acme Cloud" \
  --set productdomain=acme.dev --set githubOrg=sourceplane \
  --set orunWorkspace=ws_XXXXXXXX --set subdomain=<workers-dev-subdomain>

# every later phase reads identity back from the placed tree — but the
# blueprint's required inputs are still validated, so keep passing them
# (a --values file is easier than repeating --set):
orun new --blueprint repo-blueprint.yaml --out ~/sourceplane/acme --run-hooks \
  --phase 02-foundation --values ~/acme.values.yaml
# … 03 (infra), 04 (workers), 04-workers-restore, 05 (edge), 06 (console),
#    08 (docs); 07 (domain) only with domain=true.
```

Three flags shape a run:

| flag | what it does |
|---|---|
| `--status` | derives and prints every phase's state and writes nothing. This is the preview — it parses the document, validates each hook against the action registry, compiles every `when` and every narration template, and does **not** probe. It needs no credential and no network. |
| `--phase <name>` | places exactly that phase. Its `requires.phases` still gates: a predecessor that is `pending` refuses the run and names it. |
| `--until <name>` | places every phase through that one and stops. |

What lands in the product is PRODUCT-ONLY: source, infra, CI, configs, and
its own docs. None of this baseline's machinery (the blueprint, rebrand
tooling, its specs, its own `ai/context/`) ships, and nothing in the product
presents it as a copy of anything. That promise is a test —
`testing/leak.test.sh` derives what every phase *would* place and gates the
set.

The workspace needs its two integrations connected once (GitHub and
Cloudflare). `03-infrastructure`'s `requires.probe` polls for up to 10
minutes, so the consent can be clicked while it waits:

- **Cloudflare**: paste the Account API token (in-console recipe). If the
  token's permission groups omit D1 Write, the `d1-edit` mint is refused
  (`parent_grant_insufficient`) and `03-infrastructure` stops with that
  message — re-issue the token with D1 Write, re-connect, and re-run the
  phase. Its three secret hooks are a *reconcile*: keys that exist are kept,
  keys that are missing are re-minted against the ACTIVE connection.

## 2. Headless / container mode (Daytona, CI, any sandbox)

The blueprint's source is this repo itself (`sources: [{kind: dir, path: .}]`),
so the container contract is a shallow clone at a pinned tag plus two tokens.
orun pins the checkout by digest into its object store before any module
reads it, so the run is reproducible and provenanced.

```bash
# The whole container contract:
export ORUN_TOKEN=…          # orun auth, headless
export GITHUB_TOKEN=…        # fine-grained PAT (scopes below)

git clone --depth 1 --branch <baseline-tag> https://github.com/sourceplane/cirrus
cd cirrus

orun new --blueprint repo-blueprint.yaml \
  --out /work/acme --run-hooks --resume --progress json \
  --values /work/acme.values.yaml
```

`--progress` is four renderings of ONE stream — they differ in what they
show, never in what happened. `json` emits the raw event objects (a hosted
runner or a console build page reads these); `plain` prints the narration
alone, one line per event, for a CI log; `verbose` adds every detail line;
`auto` is narration with the engine's facts under it.

| requirement | detail |
|---|---|
| image deps | `git`, `gh`, `node` (≥20), `pnpm`, `python3`, `curl`, `orun` ≥ v2.56.2. The product's `ci.yml` lane pin matches |
| `ORUN_TOKEN` | orun access token; the typed actions authenticate with it (no login flow) |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | fine-grained PAT: **read** on `sourceplane/cirrus` (the clone); on the PRODUCT repo: **contents write** (pushes), **pull-requests write** (landings), **actions read+write** (`orun.run/watch@v1` watches runs and auto-resumes via `gh run rerun`), **checks read**; **repo create** on the org if `01-scaffold` creates the repo (or pre-create it — supported) |
| pinning | the clone's `--branch <tag>` pins EVERYTHING: the blueprint, its modules, and the hooks' scripts all come from that one commit. Use a tag for reproducible bootstraps; `main` for latest |
| workdir | `--out` is the product tree and is stable across phases and re-runs (idempotent). The baseline checkout is `{{ .baseline.dir }}` to every hook |
| classic-token caveat | a CLASSIC PAT or gh OAuth token additionally needs the `workflow` scope to push `.github/workflows/` (hit live); fine-grained PATs need only `contents: write` |
| identity | commits fall back to `bootstrap-bot` when no git identity is configured |

> **Contract change (BE4).** Earlier baselines were bootstrapped with
> `orun workflow run github:sourceplane/cirrus@<ref>//flows/phases/NN/workflow.yaml`.
> There are no per-phase remote references any more, because there are no
> per-phase workflows: one pinned artifact, selected with `--phase <name>`.
> The five inputs were renamed to the manifest's keys in the same change —
> `repoName`→`reponame`, `productName`→`productname`,
> `productDomain`→`productdomain`, `apiBaseUrl`→`apibaseurl`,
> `workersDevSubdomain`→`subdomain` — so what an operator types in the
> console form and what the blueprint declares are now the same words.

## 3. After the baseline is live

- **Custom domain**: create the product zone in Cloudflare, then run
  `--phase 07-domain --set domain=true` (see
  [docs/phases/07-domain.md](docs/phases/07-domain.md)), and re-run
  `--phase 08-docs` so the docs pick up the domain URLs.
- **Runtime secrets** (OAuth client secrets, billing keys, …): seed with
  `orun secrets set <KEY> --org <org> --env <env>`; the next deploy pushes
  them to the workers (`wire-now-seed-later` — nothing blocks on them).
- **Incremental rollouts**: normal PRs — merges to `main` converge
  automatically.

## Troubleshooting (everything we hit doing this for real)

| Symptom | Cause → fix |
|---|---|
| `03-infrastructure` waits on connections, then stops | Consent not granted yet — console → Integrations, then re-run the phase (idempotent). The probe is a *wait*, not a failure: a consent nobody has clicked is not a broken build. |
| A phase refuses with `requires: 02-foundation (pending)` | Its predecessor has not been placed into this `--out`. Run that phase, or `--resume`. A predecessor that is `drifted` SATISFIES the requirement — its files are all there. |
| `--resume` prints "leaving 01-scaffold as placed" | Expected after branding. Every file is present but differs from the blueprint, so the phase is `drifted` and re-placing it would revert your product's identity. Re-place one deliberately with `--phase <name>`. |
| Secrets listed `orphaned` | Their connection was revoked/replaced (e.g. OAuth app scopes changed). Re-connect the provider and re-run `--phase 03-infrastructure`: `orun.integrations/reconcile@v1` re-mints only the missing keys against the ACTIVE connection. |
| Secret WRITE fails `not_found` while listings work | The API key's role is below ADMIN (resource-hiding masks the denial). Re-mint the key with the admin role; the reconcile says so in the error and is idempotent. |
| D1 or KV lane: resource name already taken | The account already has `<repo>-<env>`. Adoption imports it at plan time when it's the *same* product re-bootstrapping; otherwise rename or delete the stray resource. |
| Terraform: resource already exists (10014 etc.) with empty platform state | `adopt.tf` handles this by importing at plan time — present in the d1 and kv roots. Roots without adoption must be state-migrated or the resource deleted. |
| Convergence run fails, lanes look transient | `orun.run/watch@v1` already resumes it ×3 (`gh run rerun --failed` = true resume: exec-id + `--retry`). Re-running the phase re-enters the watch on the same run. |
| Worker verify lane: missing `WIRING_*` secret | Its terraform upstream hasn't applied (check that lane first) — inside one convergence run the DAG guarantees order; across manual partial runs it does not. `04-workers` guards this with a `requires.probe` on both keys. |
| D1 lane or db-migrate: `Authentication error (10000)` | The lane resolved `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` (workers-deploy), which cannot touch D1. Both D1 components must bind `CLOUDFLARE_D1_TOKEN`. |
| CLI login dies with 429 `rate_limited` | Fixed ≥ v2.48.1 (redeem honors Retry-After). Upgrade the CLI. |
| `unknown flag: --phase`, or `cannot unmarshal !!map into []scaffold.Hook` | The CLI is below the v2.56.2 floor. Nothing in this repo is readable by an older one. |
| `✕ input "productdomain" is required` | Required inputs are validated before anything else, so this names the key nobody typed. All four requireds — `reponame`, `productname`, `productdomain`, `githubOrg` — must be set on every invocation, including single-phase ones. |
| Console/edge smoke fails right after the FIRST deploy of a worker | workers.dev route propagation race — the deploy lane's smoke retries with backoff (stack-tectonic ≥ 0.18.2); a convergence resume clears older pins. |
| Terraform lane: "state already locked" by ITS OWN plan | Backend lock-release race — a convergence resume clears it. |
| Environment cannot observe GitHub Actions (gh 403) | `orun.pr/land@v1` and `orun.run/watch@v1` fall back to plain REST automatically. If even REST Actions is blocked, the watch reports it rather than hanging — verify the run out-of-band before the next phase. |
| Many lanes queued, none claiming | Runner-pool starvation — `max-parallel: 8` in ci.yml is deliberate (resolve-herd); patience, or check the run isn't superseded. |

## Architecture invariants this depends on

- **Phase state is derived, never stored.** Nothing in `--out` records which
  phases have run; the engine asks the tree. A stored file would be a cache,
  and it must always be safe to delete — which is what makes a phase runnable
  alone, months later, from a fresh container.
- **CI holds one credential: `GITHUB_TOKEN`.** Provider credentials are
  brokered per run from workspace integrations; terraform state lives on the
  platform (`backend "http"`, run-token auth); terraform outputs travel as
  lease-published job-output secrets. No AWS, no Secrets Manager, no
  long-lived provider tokens anywhere. The bootstrap's own secret hooks hold
  no value either: a brokered secret is a pointer at a connection and a scope
  template, minted just-in-time at resolve.
- **Resume-capable CI**: exec-id is the GitHub run id (no attempt suffix) and
  every lane passes `--retry` — `gh run rerun --failed` is a true resume.
- **Parked-by-default fleet** at instantiation; the bootstrap un-parks it in
  one push. `cloudflare-domain` is the only component parked by design.
