# THE REBRAND WRITES EACH VALUE ONCE, AND WHAT IT WROTE STAYS WRITTEN.
#
# Two defects, both found bootstrapping sourceplane/altocumulus into workspace
# `cirrus-test` (ws_79BDXAZQ):
#
# 1. A `secret://<workspace>/<project>/<env>/<KEY>` ref is verified by the
#    platform's resolve against the run's own workspace — by slug, public id or
#    ws_ ref. The blueprint hands rebrand.mjs the workspace as a ws_… id and no
#    slug, and rebrand used to skip ws_ ids and fall back to the REPO name:
#
#      Ref workspace "altocumulus" does not name this run's workspace
#
# 2. The rules run in sequence, and each wrote its value where every LATER rule
#    could match it again. A value containing a baseline word was rewritten a
#    second time — the workspace this was found in is literally `cirrus-test`:
#
#      secret://cirrus-test/altocumulus/…  →  secret://altocumulus-test/altocumulus/…
#
#    and a bootstrap re-runs the rebrand over the whole tree in every phase, so
#    even a value written correctly once was mangled by the next phase's pass.
#
# This drives the real rebrand.mjs over a one-file tree and compares the file.
# Needs: node, git. No network.
